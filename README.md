# Contracts
Smart contracts for the Grid+ Platform.

## Registry.sol
The registry contract. Grid+ holds administrator privilege and whitelists
agent setup keys by mapping them to hashed serial numbers (generated by Grid+).
Upon setup, the client [generates](https://github.com/GridPlus/client/blob/master/init/main.go#L71) a new wallet key and [replaces](https://github.com/GridPlus/client/blob/master/src/rpc/eth.go#L98) the setup key
on this registry.
The owner also claims ownership of this new wallet key by querying the agent over
a local area network.

## BOLT.sol
A standard ERC621 token (extension of ERC20 + increaseSupply/decreaseSupply functionality). This will be a stable coin on the Grid+ platform.

## TokenChannels.sol
A minimally viable implementation of payment channels. More functionality will be added before taking this to production (especially dispute resolution).
