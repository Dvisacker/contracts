# Contracts
Smart contracts for the Grid+ Platform.

## Registry.sol
The registry contract. Grid+ holds administrator privilege and whitelists
agent setup keys by mapping them to hashed serial numbers (generated by Grid+).
Upon setup, the client [generates](https://github.com/GridPlus/client/blob/master/init/main.go#L71) a new wallet key and [replaces](https://github.com/GridPlus/client/blob/master/src/rpc/eth.go#L98) the setup key
on this registry.
The owner also claims ownership of this new wallet key by querying the agent over
a local area network.

## USDX.sol
A standard ERC20 token that is used to pay bills. This will be backed by USD.

## ERC20.sol
A representation of the ERC20 standard used as a base class for all tokens.
